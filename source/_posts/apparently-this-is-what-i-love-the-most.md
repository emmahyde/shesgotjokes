Here are a couple of my top played games ever, regardless of what I think, and a little bit about what I do think:

| The Game I Played | Hours Played | Why I Played it for So Long                                  |
| :---------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Minecraft         | Unknown      | The clients responsible for Minecraft do not track character playtime, but our rough calculations show that I have played Minecraft for, at the very least, 600 hours. This is a major lowball, I am basically isolating a particular time (2011-2013) and throwing out the many hours I have played outside of that. If my Minecraft account had hours played, I assume it would be highest on this list by a huge margin – we call that a "landslide". If you are ever bored, commit to reconstructing a scale model of Moscow during peak strength of Soviet Presence with a bunch of baby blocks and your friend who doesn't sleep. |
| Crusader Kings    | 370 hr       | Between both the second and third installment, I have played nearly 400 hours of Christian Politics and Leprosy Simulator. Lots of people don't "get" Crusader Kings, I assume because it is notorious for a steep learning curve in an already complex and highly detailed simulation of all living humans on The Continent from 867–1453. Maybe people don't like history ("the past is stupid!") or having fun ("why would I play that when I can just stare at the wall, sighing for 10 hours?"), but this game takes The Sims and shoves it into Civilization with a chillin' vibe and a phat pause button. The narrative possibilities are endless; it's event- and occurrence-driven nature creates a game that is infinitely replayable. I have played 370 hours of this, and have never played anywhere to the right of Poland, or gotten to year 1453. Some might say I have not ever *finished a game* of Crusader Kings, let alone seen all it has to offer, to which I would say, "finishing is simply an arbitrary date at which you are no longer allowed to play for no reason." I think Socrates said that. And indeed, would you say I haven't lived because I haven't died? Really makes you think. |
| Fallout 3         | 300 hr       | I played Fallout 3 for the first time the day it was released. We were coming hot off of Oblivion and I was thirsty for more Bethesda. What followed was a blur – I cannot confidently say that I definitely went to school. I don't remember much from this time, but I do have a selection for you. I remember at one point, I genuinely had the thought, "I feel like spending this much time alone in my room is changing my personality (a problem I would be seeing more of in future years and *especially* this year!!)." and then, a couple of days later, I had a close friend of mine who had no real interest in video games over and tried to incorporate her into playing by asking her to look stuff up in the 600-page walkthrough and read it out loud to me over the course of several hours. In hindsight, while well-meaning, this was probably not that fun; but my need to LOOT was too great. Remains one of the best Open World games I've ever played. I know that people resent Fallout 3 for any number of reasons (new vegas is better, the originals were better, its utter garbage, can't you see, etc.) but it was my introduction to the series, and to a world I was far more compelled to be in than that of The Elder Scrolls. It was also one of my most memorable immersion experiences, it was somehow a JOY to be in the Wasteland, despite the apocalyptic context. I forgot entirely that I had to also live in the real world, which was a bummer for Katie when she was reading basically MapQuest so I could direct my polygons around at maximum efficiency in my meaningless second life. |
| Rocket League     | 280 hr       | I hate competitive multiplayer games, which I'll discuss continuously forever, but for now I will just say this: I play video games to relax. I find video games cathartic, and I like when they take my mind off of real world occurrences (xoxo anyone else living in America these days??). I would define myself as "pathetically cooperative"; when asked to compete I ruin the game by respecting the opponent and sometimes secretly cheering them on. This also, of course, is everyone in the world's favorite type of game, so I end up trying a lot of these games for about 10-20 minutes each. a round of Rocket League is about 20 minutes long, and my. God. This game has everything: outfits for your car, a halting list of canned expressions you can send to other players, and a very low barrier for entry. Send the car (so fast) into the ball and when you make contact we all scream with happiness! I love my baby cars game as much as I love the baby blocks game. It literally doesn't matter if I'm losing. This is an excellent game for long nights where you literally only play this game until you die. |
| Elite: Dangerous  | 185 hr       | At the beginning of 2020, before the edging of Coronavirus really took form, I decided I was obsessed with flight sims. I saw some of the behind the scenes videos for Microsoft Flight Sim 2020 and I basically had a stroke. Mapping the entire world at a 1:1 scale was a really awesome use of modern data, and a true revival of the flight sim. In the meantime, I became very excited about ANY flight sims, so I landed on Elite: Dangerous. The premise of Elite: Dangerous is "it's space. make money. good luck!". I ended up with a pretty involved HOTAS setup (Hands-On-Throttle and Stick), and then figured, what the hell, I'll get VR too. I had a few weeks where it was all I could think about and I was using a bunch of third-party tooling to track the economy trends. That's when you know (that it will end up on this list, and a couple others, like Nerdiest Worst Things I've Ever Done). |
